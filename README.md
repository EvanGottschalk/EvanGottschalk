Python Developer - After learning Python while pursuing my math degree, I began to work on my own Python projects. Over the past 8 years, I have developed a wide variety of my own applications, including: video games; cryptocurrency trading apps; data & trend analysis; automation of video game playing; automation of cryptocurrency trading.

I am very interested in branching out and working with others on their projects. Please contact me if you have a Python project in need of development.
