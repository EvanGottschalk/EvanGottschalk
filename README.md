Python Developer - After learning Python while pursuing my math degree, I began to work on my own Python projects. Over the past 10 years, I have developed many of my own applications with widely varying purposes, including: video games; cryptocurrency trading; data & trend analysis; automation of video game playing; automation of cryptocurrency trading.

I am very interested in branching out and working with others on their projects. Please contact me if you have a Python project in need of development.
