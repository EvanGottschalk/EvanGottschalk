Blockchain Developer - Over the past 5 years, I've created numerous blockchain projects, including trading bots, price predictors, trading GUIs, arbitrage bots, NFT projects and beyond. I'm deeply entrenched and in love with blockchain, and I use defi platforms and own NFTs on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Algorand, Avalanche, Elrond, Tezos, Cardano, Cosmos, Tronix, and Aptos, to name a few. Recently, I've worked as Blockchain Architect for a startup named [EcoVerse](https://ecoverse.io/), where I led the development and implementation of dozens of NFT campaigns for brands and artists, often incorporating our most innovative product, [Fan Minted Moments](https://fanmintedmoments.io/). In addition to writing smart contracts in Solidity and Rust and managing our web2 and web3 developers, I also wrote machine learning algorithms in Python to generate visual art and music for NFTs.

I am very interested in working on cutting-edge blockchain products. Please contact me if you or your company has a blockchain or machine learning project in need of a developer or development manager.
